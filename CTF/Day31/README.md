For today's room, the most important thing I learned was working with multiple sessions while upgrading my shell to Meterpreter using Metasploit.
First, I started with an Nmap scan of the ports and found a vulnerability on the Windows host. Then, using that vulnerability, I exploited the host with Metasploit and upgraded my shell to Meterpreter using "post/multi/manage/shell_to_meterpreter". Once I was on the system, it was straightforward to find the flags.
