Cryptographic failures often involves techniques like "Main in the Middle Attacks"

Injection attacks depend on what technologies are used and how these tehcnologies interpret the input.
- SQL Injection : occurs when user-controlled input is passed to SQL queries. As a result, the attacker can pass in SQL queries to manipulate the outcome of such queries. Modify and delete information in a database. 
- Command Injection : Occurs when user input is passed to system commands. 
Prevention injection attacks is ensuring that user-controlled input is not interpreted as queries or commands.
- Using an allow list : when input is sent to the server, this input is compared to a list of safe inputs or characters
- Stripping input
