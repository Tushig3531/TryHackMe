Vulnerability scans:
* Authenticated Scans 
- Identifies the vulnerabilities that can be exploited by the attackers having access to the host
- It provides a deeper visibility into the target system by scanning its configuration and installed applications.
* Unauthenticated Scans:
- no access to the subject host.
- It is less resource-intensive and straightforward to set up.

* Internal Scans:
- Conducted from inside the network
- Vulnerabilites exploited inside the network

* External Scans:
- outside network
- vulnerabilites exploited outside the network

Vulnerabilit Scanners:
- Nessus
- Qualys
- Nexpose
- OpenVAS (Open Vulnerability Assessment System)

CVE stands for Common Vulnerabilities and Exposures
CVSS stands for Common Vulnerablities Scoring System

Lastly, as practice I have worked on OpenVas.
