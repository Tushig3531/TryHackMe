CAPA --> static analysis
Static Analysis : Analyzing malware withouth executing it, but in a controlled environment.
Dynamic Analysis : Analyzing malware by running it in a controlled environment.

Capa (Common Alaysis Platform for Artifacts) it tool designed to identify the capabilites present in executable files like Portable Executables (PE), ELF binaries, .NET modules, shellcode, and even sandbox reports.
It analyzes the file and applying a set of rules that describe common behaviours

**Malware Behavior Catalogue (MBC)**
- **Anti-Behavioral Analysis** : Malware attempts to **avoid detection** by hindering behavioural analysis using tools like sandboxes or debuggers.
- **Anti-Static Analysis** : Malware attempts to **obstruct or add complexity** to static analysis, making it more challenging for security professionals to identify and understand its malicious behaviours and intentions.
- **Collection** : Malware focuses on **identifying and gathering information** from the targeted machine or network.
- **Command and Control** : Malware typically **establishes communication with compromised systems** through various methods such as command and control servers, peer-to-peer networks, or other means. This communication allows the malware to control the compromised systems, enabling the attackers to execute commands, exfiltrate data, or carry out other malicious activities.
- **Credential Access** : The primary aim of malware is to **steal account credentials**, such as usernames and passwords.
- **Defense Evasion** : The malware **aims to bypass and circumvent the various detection** and security mechanisms present within the system to avoid being detected or mitigated.
