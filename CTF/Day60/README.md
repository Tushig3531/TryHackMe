The **MITRE ATT&CK® framework is “a globally-accessible knowledge base of adversary tactics and techniques based on real-world observations**. The ATT&CK knowledge base is used as a foundation for the development of specific threat models and methodologies in the private sector, in government, and in the cyber security product and service community.”
