For today's practice, I have learned how I can apply my knowledge in MITRE, Pyramid of Pain, Kill Chain and Unified Kill Chain in practice. Even though both of the room went straight forward, it was crucial to work on example work of how analysts exactly identify the attack and how to stop them, such as creating rules on Summit room and identifying the attack strategies on Eviction room.
