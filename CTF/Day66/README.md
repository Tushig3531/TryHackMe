Today's capture-the-flag was interesting.
First, I started with five phishing emails and answered some basic questions about them. Then I opened the phishing attachment with a text editor and everything changed. I found the URL, and by navigating through it I found the root of the phishing attachment, which contained the source code and logs. Using that information, I managed to capture the flag: THM{pL4y_w1Th_tH3_URL}.
