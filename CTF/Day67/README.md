---


### Scenario Overview
In this scenario, I was placed in the middle of a **live phishing attack** occurring inside a corporate network.  
My responsibilities were to:

- Monitor real-time security alerts  
- Analyse each stage of the attack as it unfolded  
- Document key malicious activities, including PowerShell executions, reverse shell connections, and suspicious DNS requests  
- Produce detailed case reports that mapped out the full attack chain  

---

###  Scenario Objectives
- **Monitor and analyse** live alerts during an active phishing attack  
- **Identify and document** critical malicious events  
- **Compile detailed reports** to help the security team understand the scope, timeline, and impact of the breach  

---

### Performance Feedback (AI Summary)

#### What I Did Well
- Correctly identified key malicious events  
- Provided clear descriptions of actions and actors involved  
- Achieved an **86.1% true positive detection rate**, showing improvement over previous runs  

#### Areas for Improvement
- **When:** I need to include more consistent timestamps to build a clearer incident timeline  
- **Where:** I can improve by adding more context on where each event occurred (hostnames, IPs, network segments)  
- **Why:** I should explain more thoroughly *why* I escalated certain alerts to better reflect attacker intent and potential impact  
- **Speed:**  
  - My **MTTR (Mean Time to Respond)** and  
  - **Dwell time**  
  were longer than average, particularly for the “Phishing” alert, which took longer to close  

---

#### Overall Result
I **successfully passed the scenario** by identifying all true positive alerts.  
My accuracy improved significantly, and by working on timeline clarity, contextual detail, and response speed, I can make my future reports even more actionable and professional.
