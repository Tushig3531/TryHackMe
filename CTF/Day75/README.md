[**Wireshark: Traffic Analysis**](https://tryhackme.com/room/wiresharktrafficanalysis)

To learn more deeply, I started writing everything down to get a better understanding.
Today, I learned more about tunneling and port forwarding. I also investigated how attackers abuse ICMP and DNS tunneling for data exfiltration. This helped me deepen my understanding of ICMP and DNS and improve my ability to analyze DNS and ICMP traffic in Wireshark, which strengthened my overall understanding of networking and security. The most interesting thing from today's study was how attackers bypass firewalls and exfiltrate data through unthinkable interaction.
