## Day 78

**Room Completed**
[**Wireshark: Traffic Analysis**](https://tryhackme.com/room/wiresharktrafficanalysis)
---
To learn more deeply, I started writing everything down to get a better understanding.
Today, I finished the Wireshark Training Room and learned how to decrypt TLS-encrypted HTTPS traffic using key logs. By exporting an **SSLKEYLOGFILE** and loading it into Wireshark, I was able to decrypt sessions and extract the information I needed.

I also completed two bonus activities: Bonus: Hunt Cleartext Credentials and Bonus: Actionable Results. Through these exercises, I learned more about additional Wireshark tools and how to turn packet analysis into practical, actionable findings.
