**Room Completed**
[**Wireshark: Traffic Analysis**](https://tryhackme.com/room/wiresharktrafficanalysis)

To learn more deeply, I started writing everything down to get a better understanding.
Today, I finished the NetworkMiner room. Throughout this room, I learned what the tool is all about, how to use it, and what features it offers. The feature I liked most was the GUI and the ability to see what operating system the user is using. Because the interface is so well designed, the tool was fairly easy to work with.
