To learn more deeply, I started writing everything down to get a better understanding.
For today's learning I have learned about how can I detect network scanning and how to prevent from it. And covered what is internal and external scanning, also what is horizontal and vertical scanning and how to detect them. Therefore, one of the key take away was working with Kibana on ElasticSearch, which gave me small but valuable practice.
