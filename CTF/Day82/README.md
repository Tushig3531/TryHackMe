**Room Completed**
[**Data Exfiltration Detection**](https://tryhackme.com/room/dataexfildetection)

To learn more deeply, I started writing everything down to get a better understanding.
For today's learning I have learned about Data Exfiltration and its Detection. Through out the room, I have covered DNS tunnelling, FTP, HTTP, ICMP data exfiltrations and their indicators and how attackers commonly use them. In the beginning of the room, I have covered the successful exfiltration cases and later on I used Wireshark to answer all the questions.
