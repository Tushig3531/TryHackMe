[**Man-in-the-Middle Detection**](https://tryhackme.com/room/mitmdetection)

To learn more deeply, I started writing everything down to get a better understanding.
For today's learning I have learned more about Man-in-the-Middle attack and how to detect ARP, DNS spoofing and spotting SSL stripping. Most importantly, I have learned more about their indicators and how it actually works in real life, and practiced the real life scenerio in Wireshark.
