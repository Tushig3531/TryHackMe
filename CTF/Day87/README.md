[**Detecting Web Attacks**](https://tryhackme.com/room/detectingwebattacks)

To learn more deeply, I started writing everything down to get a better understanding.
For today’s learning, I focused on detecting common application attacks such as brute force and SQL injection. The subjects I covered today were fully addressed through the learning process, but it was good to review them. The key takeaway was that if an attack occurs on the client side, analysts cannot detect it, and that writing a WAF rule is important.
