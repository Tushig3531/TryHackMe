[**Detecting Web Shells**](https://tryhackme.com/room/detectingwebshells)

To learn more deeply, I started writing everything down to get a better understanding.
For today’s learning, I discovered web shells and how to detect them. The session was straightforward, and my foundation in using reverse shells from previous labs and prior experience made it easy for me to understand the topic and follow through. The key takeaway was detecting web shell attacks through Wireshark and access logs, and understanding where web shells are commonly placed on web servers in Apache and Nginx.
