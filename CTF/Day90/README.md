To learn more deeply, I started writing everything down to get a better understanding.
For today, I covered Windows security log files, and most importantly, Event Viewer really caught my attention. I enjoyed working with Event Viewer—it’s clear, easy to understand, and the verbose details were really helpful. I also reviewed key Windows and Sysmon Event IDs, and learned where to find the PowerShell history file.
