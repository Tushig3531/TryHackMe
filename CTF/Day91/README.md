To learn more deeply, I started writing everything down to get a better understanding.
For today, I covered Windows threat detection involving removable media, phishing, and Remote Desktop Protocol (RDP) attacks, and how we can detect these using Event Viewer. One of the biggest takeaways was Censys Search—an internet asset discovery search engine that scans the public internet and identifies which services (ports) are exposed. Security teams use this to find and reduce unnecessary exposure by closing or securing open ports. If an IP address or host is publicly accessible, botnets may attempt to brute-force it—like mosquitoes drawn to a light at night.
