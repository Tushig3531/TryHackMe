# Capture the Flag Everyday Challenge

I am starting a personal challenge to **capture at least one flag every day until I graduate**.  
The goal is to build consistent hands-on experience in cybersecurity, practice different skills daily, and track my growth over time.

## Why This Challenge?
- To sharpen my **cybersecurity fundamentals**  
- To practice **real-world attack and defense techniques**  
- To stay consistent with **daily learning and problem-solving**  
- To build a strong **portfolio of CTF writeups and notes**

---

## Challenge Rules
1. Complete at least **one CTF, lab, or room per day**  
2. Document what I learn in **daily logs or writeups**.  
3. Continue this routine **until graduation**.

## Tracking Progress
I’ll keep updating this repository with **daily notes, writeups, and reflections**.  
This way, I can look back on my journey and measure how much I’ve grown.

## Long-Term Goal
By the time I graduate, I want to have:  
- A strong habit of daily practice  
- A detailed archive of solved challenges  
- Skills to pursue a career in **cybersecurity and penetration testing**
