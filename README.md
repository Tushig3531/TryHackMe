I'm actively working through TryHackMe to improve my Linux skills, build a strong foundation in cybersecurity, and gain practical experience in ethical hacking. These hands-on labs help me understand core security concepts, system vulnerabilities, and real-world attack techniquesâ€”all of which are essential for my future career in cybersecurity. My goal is to become a well-rounded security professional, capable of both defending and understanding how attackers think.
