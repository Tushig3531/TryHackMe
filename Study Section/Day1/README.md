# TryHackMe – Day 1: Starting the Journey

I've created my account on **TryHackMe** and officially started my first lesson in what I hope will be a long and rewarding journey into the world of **cybersecurity**.

## What I Learned Today

### Gobuster – Directory and Subdomain Brute Forcing
Today, I was introduced to **Gobuster**, a powerful tool used to brute-force hidden directories and subdomains on web servers. Here’s what I practiced:

- `-u` flag: specifies the target URL (the website we want to scan)
- `-w` flag: provides a wordlist (dictionary) to iterate through possible directories or subdomains

Using Gobuster, I was able to discover a **hidden subdomain**. Upon accessing it, I was redirected to a **transfer page** that lacked security protections—this was our target. After interacting with this page, I successfully completed my **first TryHackMe room**.

## Career Path Overview in Cybersecurity
The room also provided a brief overview of various roles within cybersecurity. Here’s what I learned:

- **Penetration Tester**: Tests systems and technologies to discover and exploit vulnerabilities in a controlled, ethical manner.
- **Red Teamer**: Simulates real-world attacks by behaving like a malicious hacker to identify weak points in an organization’s defenses.
- **Security Engineer**: Designs, monitors, and maintains secure systems and infrastructure to protect against cyber threats.

##  Why I'm Doing This

I’m using TryHackMe to:
- Improve my **Linux skills**
- Build a solid foundation in **cybersecurity fundamentals**
- Learn practical **ethical hacking** techniques for my future career as a cybersecurity professional

This is just the beginning. More rooms and deeper knowledge ahead!
