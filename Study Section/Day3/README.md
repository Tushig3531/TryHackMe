# Daily Practice: Search Skills

## Overview
In today’s exercise, I focused on honing my search skills and gaining a deeper understanding of how search engines work under the hood. As I explored efficient search techniques, I envisioned the World Wide Web as a vast “space” of interconnected computers and resources—where individual portfolios and organizational websites are like planets within that expanse. In this analogy, search engines serve as both navigational tools and star charts, guiding us from one “planet” to another using carefully chosen keywords.

## What I Learned

- **Efficient Search Techniques**  
  – Crafting precise queries to narrow down results quickly  
  – Using advanced operators and filters to refine searches  

- **How Search Engines Work**  
  – Crawling and indexing web content  
  – Ranking results based on relevance signals  
  – The role of keywords and metadata  

- **Analogy: The Web as Space**  
  – Websites = planets  
  – Search engines = navigation systems & star charts  

## Tools and Services Explored

- **Shodan**  
  A search engine for discovering internet-connected devices and IoT endpoints.  

- **Censys**  
  Provides detailed information on every reachable server and device on the Internet.  

- **VirusTotal**  
  Analyzes files, URLs, and hashes against dozens of antivirus engines and malware scanners to report whether they are clean or malicious.  

- **Have I Been Pwned (HIBP)**  
  Checks whether your email or password has appeared in known data breaches.  

> **Most Interesting:**  
> VirusTotal stood out for its ability to inspect file hashes or URLs, run them through multiple malware engines, and return a clear “clean” or “infected” verdict.

## Command-Line Skills

- **`netstat`**  
  Displays active network connections and listening ports.  
  ```bash
  netstat -a
